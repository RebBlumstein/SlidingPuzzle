Sliding Puzzle â€” a 5x5 sliding tile puzzle

This is a 5x5 sliding tile puzzle. You have to get the numbers in order from 1 in the top-left to 24 in the second-to-last place in the last row, with the empty tile ending in the bottom-right.
To move, you slide pieces into the empty tile by clicking on them. There will be four or less possible pieces that can be moved at any time, and these are the only pieces that will respond to clicks.
